### Fixed
- Forced UTF-8 encoding to prevent character mangling, thanks

### Added
- Simplified API: `Artist.songs` and `Song.lyrics` are now properties that are
  loaded on first access, so calling `load()` is no longer necessary.
- Simplified API: `Artist.load()` and `Song.load()` return `self` so that you
  can perform further operations.
